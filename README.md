- When clicking href in topnav while in mobile view, close the menu

- Number of socials-stats icons on leaderboard rows depends on current screen size
- "Featured" to navbar
- "Browse" goes to feeatured page but a slightly different vresion wheres everything is shuffled and/or pulls from a different database
- Number of items on navbar depends on screen size (and word/texts replaced with icons)
