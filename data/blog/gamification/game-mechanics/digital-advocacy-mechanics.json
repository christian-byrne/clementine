As part of its Fossil Free campaign, 350.org mobilizes activists to pressure institutions such as universities, churches, and pension funds to divest from fossil fuel companies. Participants in the campaign can track the progress of divestment commitments on a global map and receive updates on new victories and opportunities for action. By engaging participants in the divestment process and highlighting their collective impact, 350.org fosters a sense of ownership and empowerment among activists fighting climate change."
