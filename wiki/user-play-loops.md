Main thing the user will do: (1) Upload selfies of what they are currenlt wearing (2) segmentation + txt2img -> the items are automatically catalogued, (3) They choose which of the items they are wearing shouldn't change which can change, (4) They choose a model (e.g., an athleisure model, a 90s model, a grunge model, etc.), (5) They get suggestions for how to complete/alter the outfit. 

Since the only user data required is a selfie once per use, it avoids the hurdle of forcing users to upload/enter their entire wardrobe at any point (the main hurdle that holds back the fashion-tech space IMO). The zero-to-demo time on first use should be <3 minutes.

In this app, I applied the lessons I learned in a Gamification course to create a more engaging interface, account for different player types, design with the user's loops in mind, and motivate desired behaviors in a purposeful way ðŸ¤—.
